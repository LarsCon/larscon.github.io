          <h3>My time in J365</h3>
          <p>
          This website illustrates my time in J365, Graphic Design, at Indiana University. We went through a variety of projects that let us explore and use Creative Cloud applications such as InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, and other creative tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are the four most challenging assignments we completed
          </p>

          <h3><span>Project 1: </span>Front Page</h3>
          <p>In this assignment, I teamed up with S. Kittelson to work on the front page of a concept newspaper. The stories and assets were provided, but depicted interesting recent events and visuals nonetheless.
            </p><p>
            Above the fold, including the first headline in the largest imagery was a bold move, but I feel bodes well. The Colts header was created on Photoshop, feeling slightly limited by InDesign, to create visual space for the title, which again came out well! I also found it fun to add Easter eggs around the newspaper; note: we are not actually a 3 star paper, but good eye.
            </p><p>
            Working with large decks in a small column was a bit of a struggle, but they helped the body text fill out comfortably around the photography. The weather was an fun visual to create as well, having the freedom to explore more illustrative forms of imagery.
            </p><p>
            Starting from the initial sketches, through mock-ups, and culminating to the final piece, all while adhering to a style guide of course, I trust you found this creation, captivating!</p>

            <h3><span>Project 2: </span>Magazine</h3>
          <p>Voila, my take on a few sections in a magazine. I created 6 pages, the front page, 2 page spreads on an article of the tram system in London, and an alternative story form on icons of British design.
            </p><p>
            The cover has a brightly vibrant shot of an iconic piece of London, Big Ben. The text accompanying it, holds close to those colors and adds a more horizontal feel to the interestingly slanted shot. The first two page spread turns the iconic sign of the London Underground into the title of the article, with visuals being bright to contrast the dark skies of a night on the town looking for the way home. The following spread illustrates more of the iconic design work, and ridiculous products. Finally. the alternative story form depicts staples of design at a glance, with visually assigned accompanied texts.
            </p><p>
            I feel the major challenge was using body text within a design. I havenâ€™t worked with large amounts of text in a magazine environment, and I think that slightly showed. The assets used I feel were thematically in sync however, and visually compelling. I also found it fun to shape the bodies of type to conform to the visual elements of the page. which I felt worked best with the main visual on the second spread. Working on a magazine felt like a new genre of design, and it was ultimately fun to think differently design-wise.</p>

          <h3><span>Project 3: </span>Infographic</h3>
          <p>I worked with N. Austin on creating a compelling infographic page with data relating to the resurgence and history of physical media forms. Using primarily Illustrator, we created each chart/graph, visual, and text. Our theming, color pallet, and writing we felt was in accordance to the data: sales.
            </p><p>
            The vinyl was my favorite visual to create, I felt the simple illustration works well to identify the piece, and of course came out nicely. It was interesting to portray the specific rise in vinyls the most, as the data depicts a very recent spike.
            </p><p>
            The creative liberty afforded by Illustrator always makes for an enjoyable experience. I hope you find it visually the same!</p>

          <h3><span>Project 4: </span>Poster</h3>
          <p>For this assignment, I wanted to create an illustration focused poster. Mostly as I felt I was proficient enough to give it a shot. Recently me and my friends have been doing a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, and I always wanted to create illustrative invitations. This was an avenue for me to explore something of that theme, in poster form!
            </p><p>
            It was made exclusively in Illustrator, after I had a loose initial sketch drawn up. I wanted to lean closer to a geometric style of drawing, favoring large shapes rather than gradients and dithered transitions. It came out as well as I hoped, Illustrator does a perfect job for this type of style.
            </p><p>
            Sadly, November 25th we did not have a meeting; but that date is very interchangeable. And with only one true vibrant color being the tertiary, changing the hue of the poster creates equally interesting color combinations for some added variety!</p>
